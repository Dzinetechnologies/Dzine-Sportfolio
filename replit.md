# Sportfolio - Sports Management Platform

## Overview

Sportfolio is a comprehensive sports management platform designed for the Indian sports ecosystem. It connects athletes, coaches, facilities, and organizations through a blockchain-secured platform that handles user registration with approval workflows, facility management, event scheduling, live scoring, and certificate verification.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React plugin

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcryptjs for password hashing
- **Session Management**: Session-based authentication with stored tokens
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints under `/api` prefix

### Database Architecture
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **Connection**: Connection pooling with @neondatabase/serverless

## Key Components

### User Management & Approval System
- **Registration Flow**: All new users require admin approval before accessing the platform
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Hierarchical permission system with roles (Super Admin, Admin, Moderator, Facility Manager, User)
- **User Types**: Athletes, Coaches, Organizations, Facility Managers
- **Approval Workflow**: Pending â†’ Approved/Rejected status with admin oversight

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Permission System**: Module-based permissions (user, facility, fixtures, scoring)
- **Middleware Protection**: Route-level authentication and permission checks
- **Session Persistence**: Local storage for client-side auth state

### Subscription Management
- **Tiered Access**: Basic, Pro, Enterprise subscription levels
- **Feature Gating**: Tool access based on subscription tier
- **Tool Access Control**: Facility management, fixtures, scoring tools require Pro+

### Blockchain Integration
- **Certificate Verification**: Mock blockchain service for achievement certificates
- **Immutable Records**: Blockchain-secured achievement tracking
- **Hash Generation**: Certificate verification through blockchain hashes

## Data Flow

### User Registration & Approval
1. User submits registration form with user type selection
2. System creates pending approval record
3. Admin reviews and approves/rejects registration
4. Approved users gain access to platform features
5. Role-based permissions control feature access

### Facility Management
1. Facility managers create and manage sports facilities
2. Users browse available facilities by location and sport
3. Booking system handles facility reservations
4. Maintenance and revenue tracking for facility operators

### Event & Fixture Management
1. Organizations create sports events and tournaments
2. Athletes register for events and competitions
3. Fixture scheduling and match management
4. Live scoring system for real-time match updates

### Certificate System
1. Achievements trigger certificate generation
2. Blockchain hash verification for authenticity
3. Immutable record storage for credential verification
4. Public verification of sports achievements

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: @neondatabase/serverless for PostgreSQL connectivity
- **Authentication**: bcryptjs for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for JWT
- **ORM**: drizzle-orm with drizzle-kit for database management
- **UI Framework**: React with @radix-ui components and tailwindcss
- **State Management**: @tanstack/react-query for server state
- **Form Handling**: react-hook-form with @hookform/resolvers
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation
- **Validation**: zod for schema validation

### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite, esbuild for production builds
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript compiler
- **Styling**: PostCSS with Tailwind CSS and autoprefixer

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React application to `dist/public`
- **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Drizzle Kit handles schema migrations

### Environment Configuration
- **Database**: Requires DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **JWT**: Configurable JWT_SECRET for token signing
- **Development**: NODE_ENV=development for development mode
- **Production**: NODE_ENV=production for production deployment

### Startup Sequence
1. Database connection validation
2. Schema migration and seed data initialization
3. Express server setup with middleware
4. Route registration and error handling
5. Static file serving for production builds

### Scaling Considerations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: Stateless JWT tokens for horizontal scaling
- **Assets**: Static file serving can be offloaded to CDN
- **API**: RESTful design supports load balancing
